## About

### Description and Purpose

**Planorama** is more than just a calendar app; it's your personal assistant designed to streamline your life. Say goodbye to scattered to-do lists, missed appointments, and forgotten memories. With **Planorama**, you can seamlessly manage your tasks, events, and journal entries, all in one place.

### Inspiration

Being a college student, juggling classes, deadlines, and meetings can feel like a whirlwind. Thatâ€™s where Google Calendar steped in as my trusty sidekick. With a few clicks, I can add my classes, assignments, meetings, and add reminders for each!

Inspired by this trusty sidekick, I would like to create a simpler version of Google Calendar, but with a delightful twist â€“ the addition of journaling!
