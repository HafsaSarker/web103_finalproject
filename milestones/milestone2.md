## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I usually spend little time in planning out the frontend (very bad). But drawing out the wireframes for the first time, felt really good. It created a sense of direction and gave me an idea of the next steps, instead of trying to come up with the layout of the website while coding it out at the same time.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

I did face some challenges creating the ERD because of the 'one-to-many' and 'many-to-many' references. It is still a bit confusing to me as I have never done it before.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I will need additional support on the calendar component for the frontend. But I am looking to libraries I can use potentially.
